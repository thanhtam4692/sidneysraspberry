    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="content-text content-text-about">
      <p>Hey mate, are you alright? My name is Tam, Tam T. Tran. Welcome to my website!</p>
      <p>I am</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A programmer: I experienced a lot of languages, plaforms and many frameworks. Programming is a way to tweak things, twist things, and put things up together to create new, fresh outcomes that I want, and adapt to my personal taste.</li>
        <li>A designer: I like designing graphically (UI) and interactionally (UX). I'm not an artist though, so don't expect any artistic, breath-taking, realistic or illusory
        product from me. I focus on clean, clear, informative yet concise interface, and stuck out, unique, entertaining and convenient solutions for better user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I love reading on my Kindle e-reader, playing games on my 3DS, and traveling. To date, I have visited 11 countries, including my home country: Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, United Kingdom (Scotland, England, Wales), France, Italia, Gemany, Czech, Austria, Greece, Bulgaria. There are so many more places on my list. And I'll keep going.</p>
