        <h2>The city in a bottle</h2>
        <p>This is my attempt to create a 3D, interactive, and animated model using OpenGL in Java. A part of a city is exhibited inside a transparent bottle which is placed in a table. The city has buildings, trees (bushes to be exact), roads, sidewalks, lamp posts, and there is a train running around the peripheral.</p>
